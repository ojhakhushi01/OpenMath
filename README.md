# OpenMath
Fine-tuning a Small Language Model (SLM) for Step-by-Step Math Reasoning

## Overview
**OpenMath** is an open-source project focused on fine-tuning a **small language model (SLM)** to solve **math word problems** with clear, step-by-step reasoning.  
The project uses **LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning** on popular math reasoning datasets and provides a benchmarking pipeline to compare performance against other open-source SLMs/LLMs.

This project is designed to be reproducible on **free Colab (T4)** or **Kaggle (P100)**
